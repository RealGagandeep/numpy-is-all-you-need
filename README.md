# numpy-is-all-you-need
This was my first naive attempt to implement a vanilla neural network with backpropagation weight update using only numpy.
This code only trains a vanilla neural network with sigmoid and relu activations, The neuralNetwork.py is a small part of the complete file. This code was made to train on the MNIST dataset, but it can be used for any classification task with 10 classes.
This code is full of bugs and potential optimizations. I used the functional programming paradigm, as I am more comfortable with it.
